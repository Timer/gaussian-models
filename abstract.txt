Sparse Conditional Gaussian Graphical Models and its learning algorithm are used to perform analysis of genomics data.
A classic use case for this is to decode SNP perturbation effects of the gene regulatory system.
The existing implementation of this algorithm has poor performance as it is interpreted (MATLAB).
Unfortunately, there is not much room for improvement in this regard and will require an alternative implementation.
An implementation closer to bare metal will allow better performance.
Which, in turn, will enable running against larger data sets or achieving the same data in less time.

To accomplish this, the library is rewritten in C++ and optimized using various acceleration techniques, such as architecture targeting matrix math functions.
Additionally, there is conditional (when it improves performance) use of GPGPU devices, which can be in an OpenCL or CUDA mode.

The correctness of this implementation is validated by comparing the output of the new implementation with the old implementation given a variety of data sets.
The effectiveness and time deltas of this implementation are evaluated which determines the overall usefulness of this project.
